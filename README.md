## Hi 👋 Hello, I’m Abdurrahim Çalışkan, a Mechatronics Engineering student who is passionate about developing robotic systems to solve real-world problems.

While improving myself in this field, I realized that my university curriculum does not include many robotics-focused courses. However, robotics is what I truly enjoy, so I actively work on developing my skills through online resources and courses from well-known universities such as Harvard, Stanford, and the University of Michigan.

If you are interested in robotics and reading these lines, I encourage you to explore my repositories. You may find useful materials here, including my notes, assignments, and projects derived from courses offered by top universities. I hope they can be helpful for your own learning journey.
